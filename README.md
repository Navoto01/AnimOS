# AnimOS: A Hyper-Animated Simulated OS Experience

Welcome to **AnimOS**, a unique project that simulates a complete, self-contained mobile operating system inside a single application. Built with a primary focus on fluid, physics-based animations and a deeply interactive user interface, AnimOS is not just a launcher‚Äîit's a digital world designed to explore the possibilities of mobile UX.

This project is a hybrid application, combining a native Android shell with a core experience built entirely on web technologies. It is a testament to the power of modern development, created by **AnonLab**.

### ‚ú® Key Features

* **Fully Simulated Operating System:** Experience a complete OS environment, from the lockscreen and homescreen to a full suite of functional apps, all running within a sandboxed `WebView`.
* **Fluid, Physics-Based Animations:** Every interaction is brought to life with custom animations. Apps "grow" out of their icons when opened and can be closed with a satisfying downward swipe gesture.
* **Deep Customization:** Tailor the experience to your liking. The dedicated Settings app allows you to change the system wallpaper (using presets or custom uploads), switch between icon packs (HyperOS vs. OriginOS), adjust icon size, control animation speed, and even change the lockscreen clock font.
* **Suite of Functional Apps:** AnimOS is packed with beautifully designed and working applications, including a Camera, a public/private Photo Gallery, a rich-text Notes editor, a multi-function Clock, and many more.
* **Native Onboarding Experience:** The app greets first-time users with a native Android setup wizard to configure essential permissions and preferences before launching into the main web-based OS.
* **Firebase-Powered Accounts & Gallery:** Log in with a persistent user account backed by Firebase. Photos taken with the Camera app can be uploaded to a public, cloud-hosted gallery for all users to see.

### A Look Inside: The AnimOS Ecosystem

AnimOS is designed to feel like a real, cohesive operating system.

* **The Lockscreen:** A fully functional lockscreen displays the time (with custom fonts), date, and battery status. It features a complete Firebase-powered login and registration system. After logging in, an unlock button appears to enter the homescreen.
* **The Homescreen:** A familiar grid of app icons and a floating dock provide access to all system apps. The wallpaper dynamically blurs and scales in the background when an app is opened, creating a sense of depth.
* **Gesture Navigation:** The system relies on intuitive gestures. Drag down from the top to reveal a notification center, and swipe an open app down to close it and return to the homescreen.
* **Performance Tools:** For power users, the Settings app includes a toggle to display a real-time FPS counter, allowing you to monitor the performance of the animations.
